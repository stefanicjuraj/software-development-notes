# Waterfall Model

The Waterfall approach to software development was the first established modern approach to building a system.

This method was originally defined by Winston W. Royce in 1970.

Sequential process control where each step in the process is well defined and all stages have a well-understood order of completion.

Each step needs to be completed before moving on to the next one - some overlaps are acceptable.

Emphasis is on **planning**, **time schedules**, **target dates**, **budgets** and **implementation** of the entire system at one time.

Tight control is conducted through the use of extensive written documentation, formal reviews and approval/sign-off by the user & IT management occurring at the end of most stages before beginning the next stage.

| Process and results are well documented.                                       | Problems are often not discovered until system testing.                                                                     |
| Detailed documentation allows easy engagement in further project improvements. | System performance cannot be tested until the system is almost fully coded, and under-capacity may be difficult to correct. |
| Ideal for supporting less experienced project teams and project managers.      | Difficult to respond to changes. Changes that occur later in the life cycle are more costly and are thus discouraged.       |
| Or project teams whose number of members fluctuates.                           | Produces excessive documentation and keeping it updated as the project progresses is time-consuming.                        |
| The client knows what to expect of the size, cost and timeline of the project. | Written specifications are often difficult for users to read.                                                               |

## When to use Waterfall Model?

- Requirements are very well known, stable or unchanging during the system development life cycle
- User community is fully knowledgeable in the business and application
- Team members may be inexperienced
- Team composition is unstable and expected to fluctuate
- Strict requirement exists for formal approvals at designated milestones
- Technology is understood
- New version of an existing product needs to be released
- Porting an existing product to a new platform
