# Scrum Framework

Scrum is built around a unit of work called Sprint and activities teams carry around to accomplish the Sprint.

## Scrum Roles

### Product Owner

The Scrum Product Owner has the vision of what to build and conveys that to the team. He or she focuses on business and market requirements, prioritizing the work that needs to be done, managing the backlog, providing guidance on which feature to ship next, and interacting with the team and other stakeholders to make sure everyone understands the items on the product backlog.

### Scrum Master

Often considered the coach for the team, the Scrum Master helps the team do their best possible work. This means organizing meeting, dealing with roadblocks and challenges, and working with the Product Owner to ensure the product backlog is ready for the next sprint.

### Scrum Team

The Scrum Team is comprised of five to seven members. Unlike traditional development teams, there are not distinct roles like programmer, designer, or tester. Everyone on the project completes the set of work together.

## Events

- Events are time-boxed
- Once a Sprint starts its duration is fixed. The events may end earlier if their goals are achieved.
- For shorter Sprints, shorter time-box is expected
- There is one additional ongoing process that has no time-box: **Product Backlog Refinement**.
  - Scheduled when needed to add detail, estimates, and order items. The time spent on this activity should be no more than 10% of the dev team capacity. This process makes the Product Backlog ready for Sprint Backlog. The product backlog items are defined so that they can be finished within 1 sprint.

### Sprint

### Sprint Planning

Occurs at the beginning of a sprint where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint. This is also when the estimation of user stories occurs.

### Daily Scrum

A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

### Sprint Review

Held at the end of the Sprint to demo the product to the product owner and stakeholders (CEO, head of the department, customer, final product vendor). Based on the feedback, the product backlog is adjusted, or the product released.

### Retrospective

Time-boxed event for providing an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself (What
worked in this sprint?) and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next
Sprint (What could be improved in the next sprint?).

### Sprint Schedule Example (2 weeks)

## Artifacts

### Product Backlog

Product Backlog lists and defines project requirements in the form of user stories that could be done within 1 Sprint: As a **role**, I want to **do something** so that **reason/benefit**.

### Sprint Backlog

Sprint Backlog is a set of product backlog items selected for the Sprint. User stories are broke down to smaller tasks that could be implemented in a day.

### Product Increment

Product Increment is a software product increment produce at the end of a development period or time-box.

### Scrum Burn-down Chart

Scrum Burn-down Chart shows the completed work per day against the projected rate of completion.

The Scrum Burn-down Chart is a visual measurement tool that shows the completed work per day against the projected rate of completion for the current project release. Its purpose is to enable that the project is on the track to deliver the expected solution within the desired schedule.

## Estimating User Story Points

All the entries within the Scrum Product Backlog have to be estimated to allow the Scrum Product Owner to prioritize the entries and to plan releases. This means that the Scrum Product Owner needs an honest assessment of how difficult the work will be. Nevertheless it is recommended that the Scrum Product Owner does not attend the estimation to avoid pressuring (intentionally or otherwise) the Scrum Team.

One commonly used method during the estimation process is to play Planning Poker also called Scrum Poker. A typical deck has cards showing the Fibonacci sequence including a zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,... Other similar progressions are also possible.

Estimation is being perform during the Sprint Planning meeting, but it is also recommended to perform a raw estimation during the Backlog Refinement.
