# software-development-notes

My collection of software development notes taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) during Bachelor of Science studies at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).

The collection can be viewed and read in two ways: by browsing markdown software development notes files (topics) within the **`notes`** directory, and by accessing the [**software development notes web version**](https://software-development-notes.netlify.app/).

## Topics:

- [**Agile Model**]()
- [**Git Cheatsheet**]()
- [**Scrum Framework**]()
- [**Software Development Life Cycle**]()
- [**Version Control - Git**]()
- [**Version Control**]()
